    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preoprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MDEV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MDEV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MDEV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported."

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. *A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is no better than one that naively predicts the mean of the target variable.*\n",

    "When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, the model suffers from **high bias** but it has low variance. Both training and validation scores are relatively low compared to other aras of the graph. This indicates that the model cannot explain the variance in the data no matter how you tweak it.\n",

    "In general: grid search is a technique to find good values for model parameters that cannot be optimized directly. It works by defining a grid over the model parameters and then evaluating model performance for each point on the grid (using a validation set (or CV), not the training data). You can then choose the point on the grid that seems to work best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Grid is commenly used to identify good model complexities and in fact, we applied it above in the task about the complexity curve. In that task, we did not know which value of max_depth is best for the decision tree applied to the Boston housing dataset. We defined a grid over the max_depth values [1, 2, ..., 10] and evaluated decision tree performance for each value from 1 to 10. This allowed us to estimate the relationship between max_depth and the scores. We used our knowledge of this relationship to choose a good value for max_depth by looking for a max_depth value for which increasing it does not improve the scores significantly anymore."

    "k-fold cross validation:\n",
    "cross-validation divides the data into K blocks, the model is fitted on K-1 blocks and tested on the remaining block. Each block plays the role of validation data in turn. This results in K different estimates for the prediction error. Their average is the cross-validation estimate. For testing, we can split the data into one training set used to train a model and into another testing set used to evaluate model performance. E.g., this was the testing procedure used above (`train_test_split`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits are that \n",
    "Cross-validation is helpful to avoid overfitting, because it trains data many times, which will avoid the situation that training set is accidently imbalanced. If there is a whole bunch of 1, and it can avoid the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can avoid data leakage through cross-valiadtion. When we used our data set over training set, data leakage is a pervasive challenge in applied machine learning, causing models to over-represent their generalization error and often rendering them useless in the real world. It can caused by human or mechanical error, and can be intentional or unintentional in both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can more reliably estimate model performance of various parameter configurations during grid search (less variance in the estimates). In grid search, there is a danger to overfit to the validation set since we use it many times to evaluate performance of different points on the grid and choose a point that delivered good performance. Hence, with more and more grid points, we are more and more likely to find a point that is good only by chance. "

Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
